## The Jupyter notebook theme for ![LaTeX](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LaTeX) lovers ![heart](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\heartsuit)

The <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="10%" /> theme aims at combining the flexibility and interactivity of Jupyter notebooks with the unique elegance and sobriety of a `LaTeX`-generated article.  The <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="10%" /> project wishes to pay a tribute of gratitude (in the name, and in the content) to two of the technologies I do use and love the most as a researcher and a data scientist.

### <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="10%" /> theme in a Nutshell

- *Computer Modern* fonts for Markdown typesetting;
	- *Computer Modern Typesetting* for Markdown Mono	
- `Fira Code` (_open source_) font as the default `monospace` for the **Code** editor (with ligatures support);
- `Hack` (_open source_) font as the default `monospace` font for **Markdown** editor (slightly better for text writing, _ed._);
- Colour Syntax highlight themes for Code and Markdown editors based on Material Design colour scheme.
    - Multiple Editor Themes supported: easy to change and customise (just a few CSS variables to do the trick!)
- Special Output formatting for `stderr` and `pandas.DataFrame`
- Extra `ad-hoc` CSS classes for extra formatting use cases (e.g. _footnotes_, _dropcap_)
  

### Sneak Peek?

Here is a [**Preview**](https://leriomaggio.github.io/notexbook-jupyter-theme/) of what [a]   `noTeXbook` looks like!

### Setup `noTeXbook` as the default Jupyter Notebook theme

To install and enable `noTeXbook` as the **default** Jupyter Notebook theme (for **all your notebooks**), it is just necessary to copy the `custom` folder  contained in this repository **as-is** in your `JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR` folder (`$HOME/.jupyter`by default)
See [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use/jupyter-directories.html#configuration-files)) for more about Jupyter configuration dirs.

```shell
cp -R custom $HOME/.jupyter
```

See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32156248/how-do-i-set-custom-css-for-my-ipython-ihaskell-jupyter-notebook/34742362#34742362) for more information on Customising Notebook style.

#### Customising the CSS theme

To personalise the default settings of the `noTeXbook` theme it is just necessary to tweak a few CSS variables. These variables have a common prefix that identifies their purpose, and what they are used for:

- `--txbk-ui-`: VARS related to the look&feel of the notebook, not related to content;
- `--txbk-content-`: VARS controlling the rendered Markdown and cells' output;
- `--txbk-code-`: VARS controlling cells editors (code and markdown)

##### Customising Editor Colour themes

In order to change the **colour theme** used by code and markdown editors, it is necessary to edit the `editors.css` file and substitute the corresponding file to import on the very top (`lines 28;31`). 

It is also very simple to create your own theme: in each theme CSS file there is just the reference  _colour palette_, and how this palette maps to specific CSS VARS (e.g. `keywords`, `numbers`, etc.).

**No CSS class nor rule is defined into a Theme file**. Each rule is defined into the main `editors.css` file, and overloaded by specific themes VARS definitions.

### <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="15%" /> shall by *thy* name

When I had to think of a name for this project, I aimed almost immediately at finding a single word that could convey the idea of integration of the`LaTeX`-__inspired_  theme for notebooks I had in mind. And so, <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="10%" />, a unique [portmanteau](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/portmanteau)[(1)]( "Pronunciation") that blends together the words **noTe**<del>X</del>**book** (_no further explanation needed, ed._), and <del>no</del>**TeXbook**, the name of [Donald E. Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)'s [book](http://www.ctex.org/documents/shredder/src/texbook.pdf) on `TeX`.

That was the omen... ü§©.

#### Credits

* The [`spinzero`](https://github.com/neilpanchal/spinzero-jupyter-theme) jupyter theme has been inspirational in the design of the early version of this theme;
* The idea of overlay of selected cells has been inspired from [this](https://gist.github.com/formigone/dbabdd4ae38ded54b6f028713ac78c8a) custom theme.
* Inspiration on the choice of Monospace fonts for code and markdown has come from this [article](https://fontsarena.com/blog/best-programming-fonts/) 
* Original versions of colour themes for code and markdown editors:
	- [Material Design Light](https://github.com/JonaDuran/Material-Light-Theme/)
	- [GitHub Light](https://github.com/primer/github-syntax-light)
