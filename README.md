You just hit the `texbook-colab` branch where the `noTeXbook` Google Colaboratory theme is available and maintained. Jump [here](#colab) for instructions!

## The Jupyter notebook theme for ![LaTeX](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LaTeX) lovers ![heart](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\heartsuit)

The <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="10%" /> theme aims at combining the flexibility and interactivity of Jupyter notebooks with the unique elegance and sobriety of a `LaTeX`-generated article.  The <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="10%" /> project wishes to pay a tribute of gratitude (in the name, and in the content) to two of the technologies I do use and love the most as a researcher and a data scientist.

### <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="10%" /> theme in a Nutshell

- *Computer Modern* fonts for Markdown typesetting;
	- *Computer Modern Typesetting* for Markdown Mono	
- `Fira Code` (_open source_) font as the default `monospace` for the **Code** editor (with ligatures support);
- `Hack` (_open source_) font as the default `monospace` font for **Markdown** editor (slightly better for text writing, _ed._);
- Colour Syntax highlight themes for Code and Markdown editors based on Material Design colour scheme.
    - Multiple Editor Themes supported: easy to change and customise (just a few CSS variables to do the trick!)
- Special Output formatting for `stderr` and `pandas.DataFrame`
- Extra `ad-hoc` CSS classes for extra formatting use cases (e.g. _footnotes_, _dropcap_)
  

### Sneak Peek?

Here is a [**Preview**](https://leriomaggio.github.io/texbook-jupyter-theme/) of what [a]   `noTeXbook` looks like!

## Install <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="10%" /> Theme

The <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="10%" /> theme is available in three different flavours: 

1. (**Experimental**) theme integration for Google Colaboratory Notebooks (via the [Stylus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(browser_extension)) browser extension) ([here ![arrow](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Downarrow)](#colab)).
   
2. `pip`-_installable_ package to embed the theme into notebooks via custom **IPython magic** (`%texify`) ([Link ![arrow](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Rightarrow)](https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/blob/notebook-magic/README.md#magic));

3. **Full-fledged** _custom_ Jupyter notebook theme (HTML/CSS): ([Link  ![arrow](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Rightarrow)](https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/blob/custom-css/README.md#custom))

### `noTexBook` theme for Google Colaboratory 

An experimental porting of `noTeXbook` to **Google Colaboratory** Notebooks is available as a [Stylus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(browser_extension)) importable style. 

#### Why Stylus?

The HTML of a Colaboratory notebook is nothing similar to the standard Jupyter notebook/lab HTML structure (so the `custom-css` cannot work). In addition, every single Colaboratory notebook cell generates a new `HTML iframe`, so making the `texify` IPython magic pretty much useless too.

Therefore, the *only* solution I could resort to was using **Stylus**.
Unfortunately it is not as customisable and portable as the IPython magic is, but hey?! Better than nothing :)

#### Install TeXbook Colaboratory Theme 

Enabling `noTeXbook` for Google Colaboratory notebooks is very easy, and requires the following three steps:

1. Install Stylus Browser Extension (**only available for Mozilla Firefox** and **Google Chrome**)
    - [Mozilla Firefox Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
    - [Google Chrome Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en)

2. Import `google_colab_stylus_theme.json` into stylus

    2.1 Alternatively, it is also possible to Copy&Paste the CSS as it is in the Stylus CSS Editor

    * [Google Chrome Stylus](./google_colab_stylus_chrome.css)
    * [Mozilla Stylus](./google_colab_stylus_mozilla.css)

3. **Enjoy!** üéâ

#### Customising the Colaboratory 

As the general `noTeXbook` theme, customising the Colaboratory version is as easy as tweaking a bunch of CSS variables:

* `--txbk-content-font-size` : Set the font size of the main notebook content;
* `--txbk-content-line-height` : Set Line height of the main notebook content;
* `--txbk-code-font-family` : Set the font family for code editor;
* `--txbk-md-font-family`: Set the font family for markdown editor;
* `--txbk-code-font-size`: Set the font size for the code editor;
* `--txbk-content-mono-font-size`: Set the font-size of rendered mono Markdown.

### <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="15%" /> shall by *thy* name

When I had to think of a name for this project, I aimed almost immediately at finding a single word that could convey the idea of integration of the`LaTeX`-__inspired_  theme for notebooks I had in mind. And so, <img src="https://github.com/leriomaggio/notexbook-jupyter-theme/raw/master/docs/logo/notexbook.png" width="10%" />, a unique [portmanteau](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/portmanteau)[(1)]( "Pronunciation") that blends together the words **noTe**<del>X</del>**book** (_no further explanation needed, ed._), and <del>no</del>**TeXbook**, the name of [Donald E. Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)'s [book](http://www.ctex.org/documents/shredder/src/texbook.pdf) on `TeX`.

That was the omen... ü§©.

#### Credits

* The [`spinzero`](https://github.com/neilpanchal/spinzero-jupyter-theme) jupyter theme has been inspirational in the design of the early version of this theme;
* The idea of overlay of selected cells has been inspired from [this](https://gist.github.com/formigone/dbabdd4ae38ded54b6f028713ac78c8a) custom theme.
* Inspiration on the choice of Monospace fonts for code and markdown has come from this [article](https://fontsarena.com/blog/best-programming-fonts/) 
* Original versions of colour themes for code and markdown editors:
